We provide here the codes associated to the paper entitled "Feeding-state dependent modulation of reciprocally interconnected inhibitory neurons biases sensorimotor decisions in Drosophila" by  Tr√©dern et al. [DOI:10.1101/2023.12.26.573306](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.26.573306) 

## Code structure

The model and common operations (i.e, looping over parameters) are defined in `models.py`.

The other scripts generate the various plots presented in the article. They can be run directly to recreate the plots as organized in the `figures` folder.
